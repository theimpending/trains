# trains
COMP 1800 Final Project
The file train.xlsx is just an example, when modify the file, do not change the name or the places of the data as the program takes the data from the excel from a specific cell. make sure the number of the stations are correct and that the times have been filled. you may modify the times to match the intended schedule. 

train_schedule.xlsx is the output example. the program is designed to make a new xlsx file unde the name train_schedule.xlsx with all the new data.
